# Gesko

Simple and minimal Jekyll blog. 
Forked from [Asko](https://github.com/manuelmazzuola/asko).
Inspired from [Klis√©](https://github.com/piharpi/jekyll-klise)

Both had some issues with Github Pages, so I decided to make it work by losing as few features as possible.
Now easly deployable on Github Pages, with:

### Features

- [x] Responsive Design
- [x] Dark/Ligh theme

- [x] About page, with Timeline!
- [x] PageSpeed and w3Validator tests PASSED!
- [x] Search bar
- [x] Next & Previous Post

## Backlogs
